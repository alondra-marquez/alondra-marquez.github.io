title: "Writing"

I believe that science is ultimately meant to improve the world we live in. Its purpose goes beyond discovery for its own sake; it should contribute to better living conditions, more informed decisions, and more just and sustainable societies. However, access to scientific knowledge is not equally distributed, not everyone has the time or the resources to actively engage with it, and for many people, scientific discussions can feel distant from the realities of daily life.

For that reason, I think sharing knowledge should be a core principle in the formation of every young scientist, including myself. If science is to serve society, it must be communicated in ways that are understandable, relevant, and inclusive. Writing is one of the ways I try to contribute to that effort.

This section is a space where I practice communicating ideas that matter to me, it includes scientific reflections, as well as book reviews and opinion pieces, because I believe that science does not exist in isolation from culture or lived experience. I hope this space allows me to grow as a writer while making knowledge more accessible and human.
