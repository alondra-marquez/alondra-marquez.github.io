    "text": "Alondra Yolotzin Marquez Mendoza\n\n\nUndergraduate · Genomic Sciences (UNAM)\n\n\nGitHub Twitter/X Bluesky ORCID Email\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to my personal website!\n\n\nAbout Me\n\n\nI’m an undergraduate student in the Genomic Sciences program at UNAM, currently in my fourth semester. My academic training combines molecular biology with computational approaches to better understand complex biological systems.\n\n\nMy primary research interests center on plant–microbe interactions and their implications for food security in the context of climate change. I am particularly interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate host–pathogen and host–symbiont relationships, integrating perspectives from evolutionary genomics, transcriptional regulation, and functional molecular biology. I am motivated by the challenge of contributing to strategies that strengthen crop resilience under changing environmental conditions.\n\n\nI am currently part of a research group at the Institute of Biotechnology (UNAM), where I am gaining experience in the study of oxygen perception, hypoxia signaling, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) dynamics during plant–microbe interactions. Through this work, I am developing both experimental and computational skills while contributing to ongoing projects.\n\n\nAcademic Background\n\n\nUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) Bachelor of Science in Genomic Sciences 2024–Present\n\n\nEscuela Nacional Preparatoria Plantel 6 “Antonio Caso” (UNAM) High School Diploma 2020–2023\n\n\nResearch Experience\n\n\nInstitute of Biotechnology (IBt), UNAM · Morelos, Mexico Department of Plant Molecular Biology Undergraduate Research Assistant March 2024 – Present Supervisor: Dr. Luis Cárdenas Torres\n\n\nBeyond the Lab\n\n\nOutside of research and university, I really enjoy reading. I’m especially drawn to science fiction and books that question society, power, and the problems we face as a world. I like stories that explore moral conflict, historical memory, and current global struggles because they help me see things from different perspectives and better understand how complex the world we live in really is.\n\n\nI also love running, especially long distances. For me, there is something meaningful about sustained effort, pushing through when it gets difficult and realizing that you are still capable of going further. One of my current goals is to run a marathon, and in the future, my mom and I hope to complete a 100 km ultramarathon together.\n\n\nMoreover, music is another space where I like to explore; iIenjoy listening to different genres because I believe it opens your panorama. Discovering new music feels exciting, like finding something you didn’t even know existed and letting it change the way you experience your world.\n\n\n\nThis website was created using Quarto."

    "text": "The Response to Hypoxic Conditions in Plants: From an Evolutionary Approach to New Strategies in Single Cells that Define the Global Response Mechanism During Biotic, Abiotic, and Symbiotic Stress in Plants.\nstatus: 2024-present\nThis project investigates how plants sense and respond to low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions during development and stress. Although hypoxia is often associated with flooding, plants naturally generate low-oxygen niches in tissues such as root meristems and symbiotic nodules. The research explores how oxygen perception—primarily through ERF-VII transcription factors and Plant Cysteine Oxidases (PCOs)—regulates developmental programs, stress responses, and plant–microbe interactions.\n\nERF-VII / PCO Coevolution Across the Plant Kingdom.\nstatus: 2025-present\nThis project aims to investigate the evolutionary relationship between ERF-VII transcription factors and Plant Cysteine Oxidases (PCOs), two key components of the plant oxygen-sensing pathway. The goal is to evaluate how these protein families have diversified and potentially coevolved across a broad range of photosynthetic organisms, from algae to flowering plants.\n\nPhaseolus vulgaris Transcriptomic Database\nstatus: 2025-present\nDevelopment of a web-based database integrating publicly available RNA-seq dataset from Phaseolus vulgaris under multiple experimental conditions. The platform aims to enable cross-study comparisons, differential expression exploration, and improved accessibility to transcriptomic data for functional genomics research.\n\nTET8 and Extracellular Vesicle-Mediated Plant Immunity\nstatus: 2026-present\nExploring the molecular role of TET8-associated extracellular vesicles in plant defense signaling and intercellular communication.\n\nFungal Adaptation: Stress Responses, Spore Survival, and Polar Growth Dynamics\nstatus: 2026-present\nThis project aims to investigate how filamentous fungi sense and respond to environmental stress through MAPK and SrrA regulatory pathways. By comparing the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans with the halophilic species Aspergillus sydowii, the research explores how stress signaling networks regulate spore viability, oxidative and osmotic stress responses, and the establishment of polarized growth."

    "text": "I believe that science is ultimately meant to improve the world we live in. Its purpose goes beyond discovery for its own sake; it should contribute to better living conditions, more informed decisions, and more just and sustainable societies. However, access to scientific knowledge is not equally distributed, not everyone has the time or the resources to actively engage with it, and for many people, scientific discussions can feel distant from the realities of daily life.\nFor that reason, I think sharing knowledge should be a core principle in the formation of every young scientist, including myself. If science is to serve society, it must be communicated in ways that are understandable, relevant, and inclusive. Writing is one of the ways I try to contribute to that effort.\nThis section is a space where I practice communicating ideas that matter to me, it includes scientific reflections, as well as book reviews and opinion pieces, because I believe that science does not exist in isolation from culture or lived experience. I hope this space allows me to grow as a writer while making knowledge more accessible and human."
